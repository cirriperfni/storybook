Raja Rishi is a 1985 Tamil movie directed by K. Shankar and produced by N. Sakunthala. The movie stars Sivaji Ganesan, Prabhu Ganesan, M. N. Nambiar and Nalini in lead roles. The movie is based on the legendary story of Sage Vishwamitra, who was once a king named Kaushika and later became a brahmarishi (the highest rank of sages) after undergoing severe penance and trials.
 
The movie depicts the life of Kaushika, who renounces his kingdom and wealth to pursue spiritual enlightenment. He faces many challenges and temptations along the way, such as the wrath of Sage Vashishta, the curse of Sage Durvasa, the allure of Menaka and Thilothamai (celestial nymphs), and the love of Shakuntala (the daughter of Sage Kanva). He also helps King Dushyanta to reunite with Shakuntala and their son Bharata, who is the ancestor of the Pandavas and Kauravas in the Mahabharata.

The movie also shows how Kaushika earns the grace of Lord Shiva, who grants him the status of brahmarishi and teaches him the Gayatri Mantra, which is considered to be the most sacred mantra in Hinduism. The movie ends with Kaushika, now known as Vishwamitra, blessing Dushyanta and Shakuntala and their son Bharata, who becomes the ruler of India.
 
Raja Rishi is a classic Tamil movie that blends history, mythology and spirituality in a captivating way. The movie showcases the acting prowess of Sivaji Ganesan, who plays both Kaushika and Vishwamitra with equal finesse. The movie also features memorable songs composed by Ilaiyaraaja, such as "Vaa Vaa Anbe Anbe" and "Kannan Oru Kai Kuzhandhai".

## Review of Raja Rishi
 
Raja Rishi is a movie that appeals to both the religious and the secular audiences. The movie portrays the transformation of Kaushika from a proud and arrogant king to a humble and enlightened sage. The movie also highlights the values of dharma, karma and bhakti in Hinduism. The movie is not a mere retelling of the mythological story, but also a commentary on the human condition and the quest for meaning and happiness.
 
The movie is well-directed by K. Shankar, who has a flair for making epic movies with grand sets and costumes. The movie is also well-written by A. S. Prakasam, who has adapted the story from various sources such as the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and the Puranas. The dialogues are crisp and poetic, and convey the essence of the characters and their emotions. The movie is also well-edited by K. Shankar and V. Jayapal, who have maintained a smooth flow and pace throughout the movie.
 
The movie is a showcase of Sivaji Ganesan's versatility as an actor. He plays both Kaushika and Vishwamitra with equal finesse. He captures the nuances of both the roles with his expressions, voice and body language. He conveys the pride, anger, frustration, love, devotion and wisdom of his characters with ease. He also sings two songs in the movie, "Maan Kanden" and "Shankara Shiva", which are soulful and melodious.
 
The movie also features good performances from the supporting cast. Prabhu Ganesan plays King Dushyanta with charm and grace. He has a good chemistry with Nalini, who plays Shakuntala with innocence and beauty. M. N. Nambiar plays Sage Vashista with dignity and authority. He has a good contrast with Sivaji Ganesan's Kaushika in their confrontations. R. S. Manohar plays Sage Durvasa with intensity and menace. He adds some drama and suspense to the movie with his curse on Dushyanta.
